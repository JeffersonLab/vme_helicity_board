Code to drive the helicity board

This was taken from Scott Higgins, where
it worked on vxWorks, and ported to Intel CPU
by R. Michaels in Sept 2013.

Directories:

from_higgins:
   helicity_code from S. Higgins
   this worked on vxWorks, though I have not tried it.

port_higgins:

   A nearly direct port of Higgins
   drvHEL.c  -- driver lib
   helbd.c   -- (main) to exercise the driver
   Makefile

   Notice things like 
               vmeOpenDefaultWindows();
               vmeBusLock();
      and vmeBusToLocalAdrs instead of sysBusToLocalAdrs


using_struct:

   This version uses a "struct" for memory map, which I 
   think is a cleaner design.

   HelBoard.c -- driver lib
   helbd.c   -- (main) to exercise the driver.
         Do this to execute the code on Linux/Intel cpu
                ./helbd
   Makefile
