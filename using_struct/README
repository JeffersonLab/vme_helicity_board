 Intel/Linux based code to interact with the Helicity board.

 It was ported from S. Higgins' vxWorks code and
 modified to organize the memory map in a structure,
 hence the "using_struct" in the name of the directory.

 I believe the history was

 Start with ../from_higgins  (vxWorks based code)
 then ../port_higgins (nearly a direct port to Linux)
 then this directory, which is my latest version.
